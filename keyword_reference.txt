# General Keywords

Note: When using the top or bottom keywords without specifying a number (n), the number defaults to 10.

1. top n

Examples:
- top 10 [sales rep] [revenue]
- top [sales rep] by count [sales] for average [revenue] > 10000
- top [sales rep] average [revenue] for each [region]

2. top n measure1 by attribute|measure2
Calculates top n items, then sorts the top items by another measure or attribute.
Contrast with top n (swaps the order of operations).
Examples:
- top 10 [sales rep] [revenue] by [profit margin]

3. top n ... ranked by
Ranks the top n items by a specified measure. The ranked by keyword only works in conjunction with the top keyword. If your search has more than 1 measure, ThoughtSpot generates the top n items from the first measure in the search.

- top 10 [sales rep] [revenue] [sales] ranked by [sales]
